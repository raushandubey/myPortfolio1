## What Was DELETED (Gimmicky 2023 Elements)

### HTML Removals:
- ❌ `<div id="particles-js">` - Screams 2023, distracting
- ❌ `.hover-zoom` classes - Overused, childish
- ❌ `.shimmer` classes - Noisy, unprofessional
- ❌ `.card-3d` classes - Gimmicky 3D effects
- ❌ `.glow` classes - Too flashy
- ❌ `.btn-3d` classes - Dated depth
- ❌ `data-scramble` attributes - Distracting text effects
- ❌ `.float` animations on profile image - Childish
- ❌ Skill progress bars with tooltips - Cluttered UI
- ❌ SVG wave dividers - Dated 2022 trend
- ❌ `.tooltip-arrow` elements - Unnecessary complexity

### CSS Deletions:
- ❌ 50+ competing animations (float, shimmer, glow, bounce, spin, flip, etc.)
- ❌ particles.js styles
- ❌ Custom cursor styles (gimmicky)
- ❌ Text scramble animations
- ❌ Border pulse effects
- ❌ Typewriter blink animations
- ❌ Magnetic button effects
- ❌ SVG drawing animations

### JavaScript Deletions:
- ❌ particles.js initialization
- ❌ Custom cursor tracking
- ❌ Text scramble class (200+ lines)
- ❌ Magnetic button effects
- ❌ Skill progress bar animations with tooltips
- ❌ SVG drawing animations
- ❌ Unbounded scroll listeners (performance issue)
